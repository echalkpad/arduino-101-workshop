# Basic Concepts

These are some basic concepts from electronics and circuits that we'll cover.
By no means is this a thurough list, but it's enough to help us understand some
of the lingo we'll be hearing today.

## Powering your Arduino

### Circuit

A circuit is a closed loop that electricity can travel in.

### Power

Power is the current that flows through our circuit.  In this case, we'll mostly
be using the 5 Volt output on your Arduino, but please note that 3.3 Volts is
available if you need it.

### Ground

Ground, also know as the sink, is where the current goes once it has passed
through our circuit.

### Polarity

Polarity is when there are two or more different sides of a component that have
different qualities and cannot be reversed.

For example, LEDs have polarity but Resistors do not.
